From a scientific standpoint, it's worth noting that dog urine has an acidic nature, and this acidity can lead to the fading or even scorching of the tree's bark on the trunk. This bark damage can create an opening for pests and fungi, ultimately posing a threat to the tree's life. Moreover, dog urine introduces salts into the soil, disturbing the natural salt balance between the soil and the tree's roots, which is known to have detrimental effects on the tree's well-being.

As New York City continues to thrive with a diverse and growing canine population, it is essential to investigate whether this surge in four-legged companionship has any discernible impact on the overall health and sustainability of our urban trees. Through the interactive visualizations presented in tableauI meticulously gathered and analyzed data from various sources to explore the potential relationship between these two seemingly unrelated variables.
